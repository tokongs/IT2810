                    The images below are my takes on "The starry night" created with HTML5 Canvas and SVG. I, the artist, am a software developer, and obviously an artist.
                    I like to eat pizza and sleep in the sun. There should be enough information here about me now. The amount of info is not specified, I don't think :(.
                    Try to move the stars around if you feel like it.

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>
                CSS flexbox is used to to organize the layout of my artworks. I chose flexbox because that's what I'm most familiar with,
                but I don't see why you shouldn't be able to get the same results with grid. Because I only need a one dimensional container i chose 
                flexbox. The usecase for grid seems to be when you have just that, a grid, meaning two dimensions. 
            </p>
            <h2>Graphics</h2>
            <p>
                I tried to split the two images in two seperate files. The SVG is places in the file named <b>starry_night.svg</b> and most of the canvas functionality is found
                in <b>canvas.js</b>. The stars in the picture is a simple array of objects containg a position and a radius.
            </p>
 
            <h3>Canvas</h3>
            <p>
                I split all the elements of the picture into it's own function. Each drawing function takes the canvas context
                as one of it's argument to avoid using the global variable too much. The drawStar function takes one of the star
                objects and draws it, using it's properties. That means we can change the properties of any of the stars and redraw them in
                another place or size. The canvas has it's own event listener which listens for "mousemove" evnts. When this event is triggered we loop through all the stars
                and check if the mouse is inside it's bounding box. If it is, we just move the star along the x-axis whichever direction the mouse is moved. After we have moved a star 
                we also have to redraw the canvas so that we can se the update. 
            </p>

            <h3>SVG</h3>
            <p>
                It was a little easier to get the shapes on the screen with the SVG than with Canvas. The fact that I didn't need to programatically add any shapes makes the
                SVG code a lot easier to read and reason with. Making it interative was also a lot easier with the SVG because I could add an eventlistener to each star individually.
                So every circle has a listener which listens for "mousemove" events. When the listener gets an event it triggers the move function. All this function does is move the
                start along the x-axis whichever direction. the mouse is moved.
            </p>
 
            <h2>jQuery</h2>
            <p>
                jQuery is used to easily select and change elements. It's also used to add my event listeners. I did not use jQuery in the SVG file as I couldn't figure out how to include it.
                The documentation is shown/hidden with the jQuery function toggleSlide. 
            </p>

            <h2>Cross browser testing</h2>
            <p>
                The testing has been done by manually comparing Google chrome and Microsoft Edge. It seems like all the "features" work the same in both browsers which makes sense seeing
                that they are both developed from the Chromium project. 
            </p>
