                    The images below are my takes on "The starry night" created with HTML5 Canvas and SVG. I, the artist, am a software developer, and obviously an artist.
                    I like to eat pizza and sleep in the sun. There should be enough information here about me now. The amount of info is not specified, I don't think :(
